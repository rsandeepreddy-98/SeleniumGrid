Steps to work with selenium GRID:
-------------------------------------
Selenium Grid in same machine:
==============================
1.In order to work with selenium Grid first we need to download the selenium server jar from
	official website---seleniumhq.org
2. After that download different drivers ex: chromedriver, geckodriver, IEdrivers....
3. Keep all the drivers and jar in one specific folder and open it with cmd.
4. First we need to start the HUB
5. Open the cmd where the Jar and drivers located and give the below command.
	
	java -jar <selenium-server>.jar hub
	
6. Once you give this command it will trigger some logs and it will start the hub in specific
	port number and will generate publish events and subscriber events(XPUB),(XSUB)
7. After your hub starts, you need to attach nodes to it...for this give below command
	
	java -jar <selenium-server>.jar node --detect-drivers true.
	
8.It will trigger logs and attach nodes to the hub.

===================================================================================
SELENIUM GRID IN ANOTHER MACHINE:
===================================
9. Now the hub will be in one machine, but to connect another node machine to the previous hub, then
	
	java -jar <seleniumserver>.jar node --detect-drivers true --publish-events tcp:<Ipaddress of XPUB> 
	--subscribe-events tcp:<Ipaddress of XSUB>
10. In this way we can connect outsied remote machine to local machine hub by pointning to 
	hub URLs.
